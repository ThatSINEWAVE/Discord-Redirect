## Customization

To customize for your own Discord server:

1. **Change Discord Invite Link**:
   - Update all instances of `https://discord.gg/2nHHHBWNDw` in:
     - `index.html`
     - `assets/js/main.js`

2. **Update Server Stats API Endpoint**:
   - In `assets/js/main.js`, change the API URL to your server's invite:
     ```javascript
     await fetch('https://discord.com/api/v9/invites/YOUR_INVITE_CODE?with_counts=true')
     ```

3. **Change Colors**:
   - Modify the color variables in `assets/css/main.css`:
     - Primary color (red): `#e60000`
     - Background colors
     - Text colors

4. **Change Text Content**:
   - Update the title, description, and any other text in `index.html`

## How It Works

1. When the page loads:
   - The wave animation initializes
   - A request is made to Discord's API to fetch server statistics
   - A 5-second countdown begins
2. During the countdown:
   - Users can still interact with the page
   - The wave animation responds to mouse movements
   - Server stats are displayed
3. After 5 seconds:
   - The page automatically redirects to your Discord server
